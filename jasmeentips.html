		<br>
		<br>
		
		<img src="../Downloads/password.png" width="426.6" height="240" alt=""/> <br>Cybersecurity experts make the recommendation of unique and strong passwords in order to stay safe.  And regularly change passwords. <br>
A strong and unique password provides essential protection from financial fraud and identity thefts.<br>
		<br>

One of the most common ways that a hacker breaks into a computer is by guessing passwords.  <br>
Strong passwords are considerably harder to crack. Which includes:<br>
<ul>
		<li>At least seven characters  </li>
<li> Doesn’t contain a real name, user name or company name.</li>
<li>Doesn’t contain a complete dictionary word.</li>
<li> Should be significantly different from previous passwords.</li>
<li class="style-password"> Should contain characters from these groups: Uppercase letters. Lowercase letters and numerals.<br>
</li>

		<br> 
		
If you have a social account with a lot of information about you, <br> you might be surprised that it’s visible to anyone on the internet and<br>  it is a big advantage for a cybercriminal to threat you.<br> 
		<br> 

Change your social network account privacy settings. <br> 
		<br> 
		Here’s how to do it on:

<span style="color: brown" class="style-span"> Keep your software up to date</span>

<br>
		<br> 
		<img src="../Downloads/software upto date.jpg" width="534" height="213.5" alt=""/> <br> 
		<br> 
For your digital protection and cybersecurity, software updates are essential.

The main reason for keeping your software updated is to stay protected from security threats. <br>  
		
The older software has the exploitable holes in the code that will allow hackers and cybercriminals to get up to good.
<br> 
		<br> 
In addition, many of the more malicious malware attacks in common applications such as operating systems and browsers are triggered by software vulnerabilities.<br> 
		<br> 
 Those are massive systems that need periodic upgrades to maintain their security and reliability. Alternatively, you should interpret these upgrades as a significant stepin protecting your knowledge, rather procrastinating about software updates.<br> 
		<br> 
<br>
		<br>
Software updates offer plenty of benefits. Includes:<br> 
		<ul> 
		<li> Repairing security holes that have been discovered and fixing or removing computer bugs.</li>
			<li> Better security- Software updates help protect your data- documents and personal information.</li>
			<li> You are no longer vulnerable to security issues.</li>
		</ul>
<br>

<span style="color: brown" class="style-span"> Avoid Phishing scams and beware of suspicious <br>emails and phone calls.</span>
		<br>
	<br>
		<img src="../Downloads/avoid phishing.jpg" width="480" height="270" alt=""/> 
		<br>
	
		<br>
Scammers use emails, text messages or phone calls to trick you  into giving them your personal information.
		<br> 
		

Here the steps you can use to protect yourself from phishing.<br> 
		<br>
	
		
		<ul> 
			<li>Protect your computer and your mobile phone by using security software. Set the software to update automatically so it can deal with any new security threats.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Protect your account by using multi-factor authentication. <br>Many accounts provide additional protection by allowing two or more login credentials<br> which are called multi-factor authentication. </li>
			<br>
		<li>Protect your data by backing it up</li>
			<br>
			
		<li>Anti-phishing toolbar- Most popular Internet browsers can be customised with toolbars to prevent phishing.These toolbars easily test the pages you visit <br>and compare them to lists of known phishing locations. You will be told in the toolbar if you come across a malicious site. </li>
			<br>
		<li> Use firewalls- it is a network security system that monitors and controls the incoming and outgoing network traffic<br> based on predetermined security rules. A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a <br>trusted internal network and an untrusted external network.</li>
			<br>
		</ul>
<br>
		<br> 

		
		<span style="color: brown" class="style-span"> Install antivirus/ anti-malware protection</span>
<br>	
<br>
		<img src="../Downloads/install antivirus.jpg" width="449.33" height="252.83" alt=""/> <br>
Antivirus software helps protect your computer from malware and cybercriminals. <br>Antivirus scans the computers through the network to data — webpages, files, apps, applications. <br>It searches for known threats and Evaluates the behaviour of the programs. <br>It seeks to block or remove malware as quickly as possible. <br>
		<br>

		<span style="color: brown" class="style-span">Avoid using public wi-fi</span>
		<br>
		

		<br> 
		<img src="../Downloads/public wifi.jpg" width="366.67" height="183.33" alt=""/> <br>
Hackers are commonly considered to have access to computers using public Wi-Fi. <br>So it is better to always use a mobile hotspot, instead of using public wifi.
